Description: We introduce motifbreakR, which allows the biologist to
        judge in the first place whether the sequence surrounding the
        polymorphism is a good match, and in the second place how much
        information is gained or lost in one allele of the polymorphism
        relative to another. MotifbreakR is both flexible and
        extensible over previous offerings; giving a choice of
        algorithms for interrogation of genomes with motifs from public
        sources that users can choose from; these are 1) a weighted-sum
        probability matrix, 2) log-probabilities, and 3) weighted by
        relative entropy. MotifbreakR can predict effects for novel or
        previously described variants in public databases, making it
        suitable for tasks beyond the scope of its original design.
        Lastly, it can be used to interrogate any genome curated within
        Bioconductor (currently there are 22).
